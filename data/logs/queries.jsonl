Below is a general outline of how to do this, along with code snippets that you can adapt to your specific context.\n\n### Step 1: Install Required Packages\n\nYou may need to install additional packages for OAuth handling. If you're using Node.js, consider using `passport` and `passport-oauth2`. You can add these to your `npm install` commands in your script.\n\n```bash\nnpm install passport passport-oauth2\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up OAuth Configuration\n\nCreate a configuration file (e.g., `config.js`) to store your OAuth credentials:\n\n```javascript\n// config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n    clientID: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',\n    clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',\n    callbackURL: 'http://localhost:8080/auth/callback',\n    authorizationURL: 'https://provider.com/oauth/authorize',\n    tokenURL: 'https://provider.com/oauth/token',\n};\n```\n\n### Step 3: Set Up Express Middleware\n\nIn your `serve.js` file, set up the OAuth strategy using Passport:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst passport = require('passport');\nconst OAuth2Strategy = require('passport-oauth2');\nconst config = require('./config');\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// Configure Passport to use the OAuth2 strategy\npassport.use(new OAuth2Strategy({\n    authorizationURL: config.authorizationURL,\n    tokenURL: config.tokenURL,\n    clientID: config.clientID,\n    clientSecret: config.clientSecret,\n    callbackURL: config.callbackURL,\n}, (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {\n    // Here you would typically save the user info to your database\n    return done(null, profile);\n}));\n\napp.use(passport.initialize());\n\n// Define routes for authentication\napp.get('/auth', passport.authenticate('oauth2'));\n\napp.get('/auth/callback', \n    passport.authenticate('oauth2', { failureRedirect: '/' }),\n    (req, res) => {\n        // Successful authentication, redirect home or to a protected route.\n        res.redirect('/');\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### Step 4: Protect Routes\n\nYou can protect your routes by checking if the user is authenticated:\n\n```javascript\nfunction ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {\n    if (req.isAuthenticated()) {\n        return next();\n    }\n    res.redirect('/auth');\n}\n\n// Example of a protected route\napp.get('/protected', ensureAuthenticated, (req, res) => {\n    res.send('This is a protected route');\n});\n```\n\n### Step 5: Handle Token Storage\n\nYou may want to store the access token in a session or a database for future API calls. This can be done in the callback function after successful authentication.\n\n### Step 6: Testing\n\nMake sure to test your implementation thoroughly. You can use tools like Postman to simulate OAuth flows and ensure that your application handles tokens correctly.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis implementation provides a basic structure for integrating OAuth authentication into your application. You will need to adapt the URLs and possibly the strategy based on the specific OAuth provider you are using. \n\n### References\n\n- **File Paths and Line Ranges**:\n  - `/Users/davidmontgomery//plugins/google-home/local-sdk-app/serve.js:1-24` (for Express setup)\n  - `/Users/davidmontgomery//npm-install.sh:1-37` (for npm package installation)\n\nFeel free to ask if you need further details or specific implementations!", "ground_truth_refs": [], "latency_ms": 55642, "cost_usd": 0.003311055}

Define Requirements\n- **Mission Objectives**: Determine the purpose of the rocket (e.g., satellite launch, crewed missions).\n- **Payload Specifications**: Define the weight and dimensions of the payload.\n\n### 2. Design the Rocket\n- **Aerodynamics**: Use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to design the rocket shape for optimal airflow.\n- **Propulsion System**: Choose between solid, liquid, or hybrid propulsion systems. Design the engine and fuel systems.\n- **Structure**: Select materials that can withstand the stresses of launch and re-entry (e.g., aluminum, carbon fiber).\n\n### 3. Build Prototypes\n- **Scale Models**: Create smaller models to test aerodynamics and stability.\n- **Engine Testing**: Conduct static fire tests of the propulsion system.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Rocket\n- **Integration**: Assemble the rocket components, including the payload, propulsion system, and avionics.\n- **Testing**: Perform ground tests to ensure all systems function correctly.\n\n### 5. Launch Preparation\n- **Launch Site**: Choose a suitable launch site with the necessary infrastructure.\n- **Regulatory Approvals**: Obtain necessary permissions and clearances from aviation authorities.\n\n### 6. Launch\n- **Countdown Procedures**: Follow a strict countdown protocol to ensure all systems are ready.\n- **Launch Execution**: Monitor the launch and ensure all systems are functioning as expected.\n\n### 7. Post-Launch Analysis\n- **Data Collection**: Gather data from the flight to analyze performance.\n- **Review and Iterate**: Use the data to improve future designs.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- **Safety Protocols**: Implement safety measures for both the crew (if applicable) and the public.\n- **Budget and Funding**: Secure funding for the project, as rocket development can be extremely costly.\n\n### Conclusion\nBuilding a rocket ship is not just about the physical construction; it involves extensive planning, testing, and iteration. Collaboration with experts in various fields is crucial for success.\n\nIf you have specific questions about any of these steps or need more detailed information, feel free to ask!", "ground_truth_refs": [], "latency_ms": 37458, "cost_usd": 0.003533444999999999}
